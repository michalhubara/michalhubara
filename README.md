A lightweight local AI model for answering programming-related queries. It leverages machine learning models to assist users in generating code, understanding programming tasks, and offering solutions based on input prompts.

This project uses **Python** and **HTML** and includes:
  - A **FastAPI backend** that processes code-related queries using **Hugging Face** models for code generation.
  - A **frontend** that sends requests to the backend and displays results.
  - **Documentation** on how to run the backend and frontend locally, including steps to **download and set up the AI model locally**.
